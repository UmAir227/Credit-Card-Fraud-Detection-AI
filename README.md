# 🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
Fraud detection is a classic case of **imbalanced classification**. In this project, I developed a machine learning model that identifies fraudulent transactions with high recall, ensuring financial safety.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Business Metrics
- **Money Saved:** $41,500 (based on test data)
- **Recall Score:** 85% (Our primary focus to minimize missed frauds)
- **Precision:** 42% (Managed false alarms)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.
